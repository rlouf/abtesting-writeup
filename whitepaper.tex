\chapter*{Introduction}

This sumarizes all the knowledge that we have accquired regarding A/B testing.

\chapter{Why being Bayesian?}
\label{chap:why_bayes}

Bayesian statistics are not self-evident in the field of A/B testing. Quite the contrary: for a very long
time, virtually all companies relied to frequentist statistics and p-value in order to draw conclusions from
their tests (AirBnB, Stakoverflow...). There's been a trend recently to go towards Bayesian methods to
interpret results (ABTasty, VWO...). Why?

The question is worth answering, as frequentist statistics are considered by most to be "easier" to use, while
Bayesian methods requires one to learn a new framework that is rarely taught at school. Here are a few
reaseons, most gathered from~\cite{Murphy2012}:


\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Confidence intervals are weird.}] Unlike Bayesian who define credible intervals based on the
    posterior distribution (thus on data only), the confidence interval is derived from the sampling
    distribution of the estimator. We condition on what is unknown, the parameter $\theta$, and average over
    future hypothetical data $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}$. This is counter-intuitive and can lead to very
    pathological situations. They can't be trusted.
  \item[\textbf{p-values, anyone?}]
  \item[\textbf{Likelihood principle}]
  \item[\textbf{It doesn't answer the interesting questions}]
\end{itemize}

\section{Bayesian Workflow}

The Bayesian workflow to model a set of data should consist of the following steps~\cite{Gabry2018}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploratory data analysis. Go deeper than simply plotting the data, look for hidden patterns that
      may biais a naive model.
    \item Choose a set of models.
    \item Check the models using fake data. In particular, judge of the adequacy of the priors using prior
      predictive checks (predicting all possible data points).
    \item Check the computation. Go beyond trace plots.
    \item Posterior predictive checks
    \item Comparison between the different models
\end{enumerate}

\section{When to stop the experiment?}

Experiment can, in theory, run forever. Often, we stop them for pratical reasons (we need the result now), or
because we have seen something that seemed significant. Both can be valuable reasons, as we will see, but the
ideas somewhat need to be normalized an integrated into a decision framework.

The idea of stopping experiments early, when there is a 'statistically significant' result is not new, and is
often justified on the basis of it being a good tradeoff between statistical accuracy and speed in decision.
Yet, this leads to several pathological cases, and should be studied more deeply.

Now, assume that we do not want to fall into the trap of 'early peaking' and choose a stopping rule that only
depends on the data that have been gathered so far. How do we choose when to stop? Does it have to be
arbitrary? As we will see, although you always have to draw a line in the sand, you can build a framework so
that the choice you have to make does not seem very arbitrary, and matches the heuristics we usually use ("Hey,
we need to put this in production by next week").

Here is how a discussion between data and product people usually goes:

"Hey, did you have time to look at the results on the feature we rolled out last week? We'd really like to
push it in prod, or take it down for the next feature"

"I did. The results are promising, but not statistically significant yet. We need to wait a little longer."

"Ok, promising is good enough to me. We really don't have time to wait for this. Close it."

Two things went wrong in this discussion:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Never} tell anyone (not even me) about the current trend on the metric, unless the decision
    tree has decided to stop. Before it is finished, it is not finished.
  \item Finishing a test before reaching significance does not make sense, as we will see.
\end{itemize}

Also, notice all the assumptions that are not spelled out:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There \textit{is} a constraint on the time an experiment can run, and we are not always ready to trade
    time for more accuracy. But how much are we ready to trade?
  \item There is a threshold of significance after which we feel we can stop the experiment. What is that
      threshold?
\end{itemize}

Clearly, there is a need to formalize and standardize the decision process. We'll see that this formalization
is not so much of a constraint---several parameters can be adjusted on an experiment basis---but it helps with
having a consistant decision protocol. Something that can be discussed in very specific terms.

\section{Impact of new features on retention}

The impact of new features on retention is not something that is obvious to
measure. When one performs a naive A/B test, where one variant contains the
feature and the other one doesn't, the question that is being answered when
comparing the retention of the two cohorts is:

\begin{quotation}
	What is the average difference in terms of retention between users who
	can potentially see and use the feature and those who can't.
\end{quotation}

However, this is not the question we are interested in. Instead, what we would
like to know is:

\begin{quotation}
	1. Of all the people who have seen the feature, how many have used it?\\
	2. Does knowing that the feature exists influence the retention?\\
          3. Does using the feature influence the retention?
\end{quotation}

Ultimately, only question (2) requires an A/B test to be answered (unless,
arguably, when the feature is hidden and it is possible to use the application
without seeing it).

For individuals in the cohort that cannot access the feature, te
